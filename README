This project repackages statsite, a C implementation of statsd, into a reusable
library. This allows its statistics functions to be reused in other programs.

To pull the latest version of statsite into this project, run the 'update.sh'
script.

See the original project: https://github.com/armon/statsite if you want to run
the statsite daemon and for documentation on that.
